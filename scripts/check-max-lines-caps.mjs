/**
 * The per-file max-lines caps in .oxlintrc.json stay honest.
 *
 * Three checks. The first two run over the config's `overrides`:
 *
 * 1. Every non-glob `files` path exists — a cap for a deleted file is dead weight.
 * 2. Every per-file cap is a RATCHET, not a permanent ceiling: the cap must sit within
 *    SLACK lines of the file's current length. Without this, a file that shrinks by 800
 *    lines keeps its inflated ceiling forever and the "nothing here can grow" claim in the
 *    config is only true at the moment a cap is written. A file that comes down: lower its
 *    cap (or delete the block once it fits the global 1000).
 * 3. A file that turns the rule off for itself is held to a length declared HERE. Checks 1 and
 *    2 only see files the config names, so a file-level `eslint-disable max-lines` header opted
 *    a file out of the ratchet entirely: it needed no config block, and nothing observed it
 *    growing. Not theoretical — a review caught `paginated-surface.ts` taking on another 243
 *    lines that way. Growth stays allowed; going unnoticed does not.
