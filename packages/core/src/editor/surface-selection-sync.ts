// The two-way selection mirror and the IME lane (paginated-surface seam).
//
// The painted pages hold the browser's own selection, so there are two copies of one fact:
// the model's and the DOM's. This module owns the traffic between them in both directions —
// reading a gesture back into the model, writing the model back out, and deciding WHICH of
// the two is the newer whenever a repaint finds them disagreeing — plus the one lane where
// the DOM legitimately gets ahead of the model and cannot be stopped: an IME composition.
//
// SELECTION GESTURES ARE THE BROWSER'S. Drag, double-click for a word, triple-click for a
// paragraph, shift-click to extend, and selecting across a page boundary all come free
// because the painted spans are real text. Re-implementing them from records is how a
// surface ends up feeling worse than a textarea. Layout still owns geometry: what comes back
// from the DOM is which CHARACTERS were gestured over, never where they are.

      // nodes the selection lives in and then write the MODEL's older selection into the new
      // ones — so a double-click was made correctly and did not survive the next scroll, and
      // the model never learned the word had been selected at all. Reading the DOM first
      // makes the repaint carry the gesture rather than erase it.
      //
      // A deliberate model move is the exception, and the reason this cannot simply refuse to
      // write: a commit installs its own post-edit caret, and the DOM selection left over
      // from before the edit addresses offsets that no longer mean the same thing.
      // The SAME two reasons `onSelectionChange` refuses apply here, and this is the reader
      // that runs on every repaint. A rectangle of cells keeps the DOM deliberately collapsed,
      // so a scroll or an undo would "adopt" that collapse, leave the overlay painting four
      // cells, and turn the next Delete into a one-character edit inside one of them.
      //
      // A REPAINT MAY CARRY A GESTURE; IT MAY NEVER INVENT ONE. `modelMoved` is spent by the
      // first repaint after a commit, and an edit can produce more than one — a settled image
      // resource, a deferred publish, a scroll all repaint again while the caret this edit
      // installed is still the newest thing anybody moved. Those later repaints used to read
      // the browser's selection and take it, and the browser's answer after a page's DOM has
      // been rebuilt under it is the paragraph start. So the first character typed at the end
      // of a paragraph landed, the caret went home to offset 0, and every character after it
      // was inserted in front of the one before: "Hello" arrived as "elloH".
